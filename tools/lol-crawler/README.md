# lol-crawler

This sub-project was created to fetch champions stats from internet and store it on a json file.

Currently it's updating this file:

`qiyanalol/wordpress/themes/generatepress-child/assets/json/champions.json`

## Usage

```
yarn install
yarn crawl
```

Then you will have `champions.json` updated.
